                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Royal Force 71 is an application of cyber security team of Bangladesh. This app contains useful links and guidelines for safe social browsing. This app doesn't require any special permissions of your phone. But it may ask for permission when needed.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Why the app needs permission?</h4>
                    <p>The app needs permission when you try to open any native function within the app. So if you want to click photo from our app, you must allow camera permission. Unless, this app can't perform any action related to camera. The same way, when you try to select any photos from gallery using our app, you must allow the storage permission or our app won't be able to read your photos.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Wat should you do?</h4>
                    <p>If you want to use any native function from our app you should get a pop up asking for permission. If you want to use you should allow it. If you feel insecure you can decline the permission. Besides, you can go to app setting and manage the permissions anytime and restrict it.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>In one word, you will be asked for permission only and only when you want to use the native functionalities. You must know that, Royal Force 71 won't use this for harming you. If you still feel insecure, just don't give permission  or just restrict from settings.</p>
